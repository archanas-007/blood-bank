        The most common blood type is O, followed by
        type A. Type O  individuals are often called
        \"universal donors\" since their blood can be
        transfused into persons with any blood type.
        Those with type AB blood are called universal
        recipients because they  can receive blood of
        any type.</string>

    <string name="cccc">Blood Bank India\' is a product developed for a social welfare initiative so
        that nobody suffers due to blood unavailability.The need for blood is great - on any given day,
        approximately 39,000 units of Red Blood Cells are needed. Each year, they intend to meet upto to 1%
        (approx) of our nationâ€™s demand for blood transfusion. \n\n

        Despite the increase in the number of donors, blood remains in short supply during emergencies,
        mainly attributed to the lack of information and accessibility. We positively believe this
        application could be a handy one and can overcome most of these challenges by effectively
        connecting the blood donors with the blood recipients.</string>
